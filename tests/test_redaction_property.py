"""Property test: a sensitive-named field never survives canonicalization.

The defect this library was extracted to fix was invisible to example-based
tests, because the examples were written against the container types the
author had in mind. The gap was a type nobody thought to write an example for.

This test does not enumerate types. It builds arbitrary nested structures out
of every container the canonicalizer can expand, plants a secret under a
sensitive name at a random point inside, and asserts the secret is absent from
the serialized output. Adding a new expandable container without teaching the
redactor about it will fail here without anyone having to think of it.
