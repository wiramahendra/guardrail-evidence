"""Shared fixtures.

The ``_no_network`` fixture is autouse and global: it replaces socket creation
with a hard failure for the entire suite. The library's central claim is that
it does not talk to anything, and the only way to keep that true as the code
changes is to make a socket impossible to open while any test runs.
