"""The one shared execution engine behind ``@guard`` and ``wrap_tool``.

The before/after flow — argument binding, observer notification, the fused
redact + canonicalize + hash, approval, the signed ``decision`` event,
execution, and the ``outcome`` event — is identical no matter how the guarded
callable was registered. ``@guard`` and ``wrap_tool`` differ only in how they
build the contract and how the target is invoked (synchronously vs ``await``).
Both delegate the entire run here, so the two cannot drift apart again.

Fail-closed ordering is load-bearing and must stay exactly as it is:

1. Bind call arguments to parameter names (``inspect.signature``), applying
   defaults. A ``TypeError`` from binding propagates unchanged: the call was
   malformed and nothing has executed or been recorded.
2. Notify the :class:`~guardrail_evidence.observer.ActionObserver`, if one was
   configured, once per contract version per process. Failure is a
   pre-execution error: the function does not run.
3. Redact and canonicalize the bound arguments in a single fused traversal,
   then hash the redacted canonical form.
4. Load the local signing identity (fail closed if unusable).
5. Evaluate approval (fail closed on provider failure or missing TTY).
6. Durably append a signed ``decision`` event BEFORE any execution.
   Denied → raise :class:`~guardrail_evidence.errors.ActionDenied`; nothing
   executes.
7. Execute the original function exactly once. This library does not
   deduplicate calls and does not make the action idempotent.
8. Durably append a signed ``outcome`` event (succeeded/failed).
9. Return the original result, or re-raise the original exception.

Post-execution evidence failure is reported as
:class:`~guardrail_evidence.errors.ExecutionCompletedEvidenceError` — a
distinct error meaning "the function ALREADY ran, but outcome evidence could
not be persisted". The function is never retried.

``KeyboardInterrupt`` and ``SystemExit`` raised by the guarded function
propagate immediately without an outcome event. A decision event with no
following outcome therefore reads as "execution started; the process was
interrupted or died before an outcome was recorded".
