"""Which names count as sensitive, and how redacted evidence is summarised.

The redaction *traversal* lives in :mod:`guardrail_evidence.canonical`, fused
with canonicalization so the two cannot disagree about which container types
expand into named fields. This module owns the policy — the name set — and the
presentation helpers that run on already-redacted structures.

Matching is by name, case-insensitively, against a built-in set plus any names
declared via ``@guard(redact=[...])``. Matched values are replaced with the
literal ``<REDACTED>``, so no length, prefix, or hash of the raw value reaches
evidence. That matters for low-entropy secrets: a hash of a six-digit PIN is
the PIN.
