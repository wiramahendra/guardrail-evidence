"""Offline journal verification.

Verification is fully deterministic and needs only the journal file and the
local public verification key. It checks, per event:

* the line parses as a JSON object;
* ``schema_version`` is a known version;
* required fields for the event type are present with sane types;
* ``event_hash`` equals SHA-256 of the canonical unsigned payload
  (everything except ``event_hash`` and ``signature``);
* the Ed25519 ``signature`` verifies over the raw digest bytes;
* ``previous_event_hash`` links to the immediately preceding event
  (JSON ``null`` for the first event).

The journal is read one line at a time, never loaded whole, so verification
memory is bounded by the largest single event rather than the total file size.

This detects modified events, reordered events, and deletion from the middle
of the chain. Deleting the final tail of the journal is NOT detectable from
the journal alone — unless the journal holds a ``checkpoint`` event, or
``verify_journal(..., checkpoint=...)`` is given a durable witness. A
checkpoint commits to the event count at a point in time; a journal shorter
than that count is truncated.
