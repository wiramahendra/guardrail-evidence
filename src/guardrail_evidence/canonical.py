"""Canonical, deterministic serialization — with redaction fused into it.

Canonical JSON format
---------------------
* UTF-8 encoding
* keys sorted lexicographically
* compact separators (``,`` and ``:``)
* no NaN / infinity
* ``ensure_ascii=False`` (non-ASCII text is emitted as UTF-8)

Hashes are SHA-256 over the canonical bytes, hex-encoded.

Why redaction lives here
------------------------
Redaction and canonicalization are one traversal, not two passes. Splitting
them is a standing invitation to a specific and serious bug: a redactor that
understands one set of container types, and a canonicalizer that expands a
*wider* set. Any type the canonicalizer expands but the redactor does not
becomes a hole through which named secrets reach persisted evidence.

Dataclasses and named tuples are exactly that shape. Both carry named fields.
A redactor written for mappings does not see those names, but a canonicalizer
must expand them to produce deterministic output — so ``Credentials(api_key=
"sk-live-...")`` canonicalizes to ``{"api_key": "sk-live-..."}`` with the
secret intact. A named tuple is worse, because it is also a ``tuple``: a
sequence-aware redactor flattens it positionally and the field names cease to
exist before anything can match them.

Fusing the two makes the failure unrepresentable. There is one function that
decides how a value expands, and it consults the sensitive-name set at every
point where it produces a name.

Value policy
------------
Deterministically converted: ``None``, ``bool``, ``int``, finite ``float``,
``str``, ``list``, ``tuple``, named tuples (by field name), ``dict`` with
string keys, and dataclass *instances* (by field name).

Anything else becomes a **type marker** of the form
``<unsupported:module.QualifiedTypeName>``, which carries no value data.
This is deliberate: guarded functions routinely receive rich objects (HTTP
clients, ORM rows, ``self``), failing the call for those would make the guard
unusable, and calling ``repr()`` would leak whatever the object holds. The
marker keeps evidence deterministic and leak-free at the cost of not
committing to the object's contents.

Two conditions remain hard failures (:class:`CanonicalizationError`), because
accepting them would make evidence non-deterministic or ambiguous:

* NaN or infinite floats, anywhere in the structure
* cyclic containers, or nesting beyond :data:`MAX_DEPTH`
